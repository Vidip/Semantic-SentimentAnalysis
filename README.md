# Semantic-SentimentAnalysis

### Sentiment Anlaysis Steps:

1. Tweets Pulled from Twitter API using tweepy.
2. Removed URL and any other special characters.
3. Created a bag of words for frequency count
4. Positive and negative words sourced, and tweets compared to check the polarity of the tweet.
5. If positive and negative value is same, then neutral is assigned to the tweet polarity.

### Semantic Analysis Scope:
Similar steps of Sentiment, but in this case instead of checking it with positive and negative words, applied the formulae of Log(N/df) where N is total documents and df is number of document containing that word which we are trying to search for.

### Word Cloud Created Using Tableau and Business Intelligence on number of programs in each department is done by making star schema and IBM's Cognos BI.
